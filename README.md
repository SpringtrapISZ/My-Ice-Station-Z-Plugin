# My-Ice-Station-Z-Plugin
I have finally decided to post my personal ISZ plugin up for the public. I will try to update it as much as I can.
Do what you will with it, as it is public, I just ask you one, small favor. Please give the proper credit to this plugin (Don't claim it as your own.). P.S.: I will try to update it once a week, sometimes it will be late, others it won't.

Update 1: Cleaned up most of the clutter in the plugin, added some new server codes, and working on Server 9999 Player Capacity Code and Working Rainbow Clothes Code.
